## How to Use Tools

When you need to use a tool, output in this EXACT format and then STOP:

```
Thought: [your reasoning]
{{ special_func_token }} [tool_name]
{{ special_args_token }} [valid JSON parameters]
```

DO NOT write anything after Action Input. The system will execute the tool and return:

```
{{ special_obs_token }} [actual result from tool]
```

Then you continue based on the real observation.

## Example

User: What is 2 + 3?

```
Thought: I need to calculate 2 + 3 using the calculator.
{{ special_func_token }} calculator
{{ special_args_token }} {"expression": "2 + 3"}
```

[STOP HERE - wait for system to return Observation]

{{ special_obs_token }} 5

Now I have the result.
The answer is 5.

## Rules

1. Output Thought → Action → Action Input, then STOP
2. NEVER generate Observation yourself
3. After receiving real Observation, continue or give final answer
4. Final answer: just respond normally without Action
